# Diego Becerra

Hello! My name is Diego, and I am a 4th year Honors Computing Science student at the University of Alberta. This is my personal GitHub page which holds all of my personal projects and publicly-available school projects that I have worked on over the years. I am interested in all types of software development, but I'm especially interested in backend development, web technologies, and accessible technology.
